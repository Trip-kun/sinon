# Oatmeal

This is the code repo for the Oatmeal discord bot in the 5183 Discord. You are welcome to use this code for whatever but no you won't get the token unless we screw up, so don't ask. 

<!--- TODO: Provide instructions on how to build project and requirements to run project --->

</br>

# Configure
## Set the bot token (currently only for linux)
Create a .env file in the same folder as the run.sh script with the following:

    TOKEN="PUT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

obviously, you replace PUT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE with your token (keeping the double quotes)

TODO: include instructions for the windows script as well. preferably make it work the same way
